# Data Analysis Portfolio
My name is Karolina. I have completed a Bachelor's degree in Economic Analytics with a specialization in Financial Analysis. 

I am proficient in the R programming language, which is an invaluable tool for statistical analysis. Additionally, I use Power BI software, which allows for the creation of interactive reports and dashboards, a key aspect of business decision-making. I have a strong command of the Microsoft Office suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access etc. I am also independently learning SQL to further develop my skills in database management and data analysis.

In this portfolio, I have included some projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Excel, Power BI and R Studio. 

Thank you for your time.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
